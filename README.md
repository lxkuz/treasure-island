# README

## Requirements

* Ruby version
2.7.1 (installed via RVM)

* NodeJS version
v14.0.0 (installed via NVM)

* SQLite version
3.28.0

Chrome web browser

## How To Start

To start web server:
`bundle install`
`bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`
`bundle exec rails s`

Open: `http://localhost:3000`

Open `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/site_map` for API endpoint check

## Testing

We use capybara with crome driver testing. Steps to enable this stuff for Mac OS:

1) Install Chrome web browser if you don't have it
2) Download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html (85's folders for Chrome 85)
3) Save it into some path, for example:
`/usr/local/Caskroom/chromedriver/85.0.4183.87/chromedriver`
4) Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`, setup correct `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH` variable as chromedriver full path
5) Mark driver as verified for Mac OS `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver` (into the driver folder)

To run tests: `RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec spec`
It will open browser during testing and apply Javascript for end-to-end testing of site map.

Then to check ruby tests coverage: `open coverage/index.html`
Current tests coverage is 100% with 10.46 hits per line 

## Linters

ESLint: `yarn run eslint app/javascript`
Rubocop: `bundle exec rubocop .`

## Decisions

`Page` model stores every site map node. Page has name, path, full_path, key and timestamp attributes.

API endpoint `api/v1/site_map` returns JSON with tree structure built on top of `Page` records.

Here is the example of such structure:
```JSON
{
  "nodes": {
    "settings": {
      "path": "/settings",
      "key": "home.settings",
      "name": "Settings",
      "nodes": {
        "company_profile": {
          "path": "/settings/company_profile",
          "key": "home.settings.company_profile",
          "name": "Company Profile",
          "nodes": {
            
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "path": "/",
  "key": "home",
  "name": "Home"
}
```

React component `SiteMap` gets this data from useFetch hook (useEffect on fetch function).
When data is ready it renders components tree on top of it. Every node renders via `SiteNode` component.

If we change `path` or `name` of parent `Page` it leads to all children update in order to compose correct full path and IDs for everyone.

For testing this try from rails console:

```
page = Page.find_by_name 'Settings'
page.path = 'config'
page.save
```
And check out all links paths. Children will become nested from `config`

## Pros Of The Implementation

* All project code structure made to be tiny and easy to support:
* Single DB structure with one table only
* Minimum DB queries during site map rendering (FYI: I use `#find_each` to iterate on data. So in case of huge data set ActiveRecord will use loading in batches to minimize amount of generated ruby objects and limit memory consuming)
* Site map tree structure is making into `SiteMapPresenter` by one loop so its efficiency is O(n)
* Site map tree data structure comes from API endpoint. It makes client rendering easy with only two React components.
* `useFetch` is elegand solution for making AJAX call and get data for SiteMap component
* End-To-End testing with capybara, selenium and schrome driver helps to cover all the process with tests
